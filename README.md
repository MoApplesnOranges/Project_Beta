## Service microservice

For the inventory, Matt and I separated the endpoints based on entities. He took vehicleModel and I took manufacturer. We split the automobile entity in two with Matt taking create an automobile form and I created the automobile list.

For the service microservice, I initiated through creating views, models, and urls for the API endpoints. I then tested to make sure they all worked using Insomnia. After which I tested my polling to make sure it was connected to AutomobileVO.

Finally I integrated the inventory microservice with the service microservice using React frontend. I created functional components to link to App.js and pulled data from both Service and Inventory microservices and integrated them to create the CarCar website.
